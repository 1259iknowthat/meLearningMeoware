# smolSetup

This is the first malicious installer that I'm developing.

### Developing with:
- C#
- Winform
- .NET Framework 6.0

### Category:
- Ransomware?

### Objectives:
- Faking Minecraft official site to lurking people to install our meoware.
- Malicious things are setup.exe and sus.dll
    
    - I'm gonna make the setup.exe look likes Minecraft installer (not 100% but about 60-80% of every installer's interface).
    - sus.dll has a simple encryption algorithm to encrypt victim's files (AES-CBC).
    - sus.dll can wipe all of the malware itself.

- ... etc (more functions or idk :D)

### STATUS: Developing...
