# smolSetup

This is the first malicious installer that I'm developing.

Developing with:
- C#
- Winform
- .NET Framwork 6.0

Category:
- Ransomware?

Objectives:
- Faking Minecraft official site to lurking people to install our meoware.
- Malicious things are setup.exe and sus.dll
    
    - I'm gonna make the setup.exe look likes Minecraft installer (not 100% but about 60-80% of every installer's interface).
    - sus.dll has a simple encryption algorithm to encrypt victim's files (AES-CBC).

- ... etc (more functions or idk :D)
